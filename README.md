## Getting Started üöÄ

**Loggi** is currently in active development, which means the full functionality and payload are not yet available for download. 

To get started with **Loggi**, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Payload File**: 
   Download the [Payload.txt](https://example.com) file, which contains the necessary configuration for your project.
   
2. **Edit the Webhook**: 
   Open the downloaded **Payload.txt** in **Payload Studio** or your preferred text editor. Navigate to **line 23** and replace the placeholder Discord Webhook URL with your own webhook URL. This will allow the payload to interact with your desired channel.

3. **Generate the Payload**:
   After editing, save the file and use the tool to generate the payload based on your configurations.

4. **Flash to Your Device**:
   Once the payload is generated, flash it onto your device to begin using it. Enjoy the experience and have fun exploring what you‚Äôve built!
